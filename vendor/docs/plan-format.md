# Plan format

<!-- crewrig-doc: section=reference nav_order=30 published=true title="Plan format" -->

This document defines the normative format for the PLAN artifact of
the lifecycle introduced in
[ADR-0010](adr/0010-spec-plan-review-lifecycle.md) — specifically
*Stage definitions → PLAN*. It is the contract that every plan SHALL
satisfy and the schema that the plan reviewer (per `AGENTS.md` →
*Plan review protocol*) and the retroactive routing engine
(issue #172) will rely on. The format is mandated by
[`specs/0004-plan-format-and-review.md`](../specs/0004-plan-format-and-review.md)
(R1..R11) and, for the tier-conditioned mandatory set below, by
[`specs/0138-tier-bounded-plan-artifacts-and-loops.md`](../specs/0138-tier-bounded-plan-artifacts-and-loops.md)
(R1); every section below traces back to one of these requirements.

## Not a file — a comment

A plan is **a GitHub comment posted on the logbook issue**, not a
file in the repository. Consequently a plan has **no YAML
frontmatter** and no file path. Future readers SHOULD NOT graft a
frontmatter schema by analogy with
[`docs/spec-format.md`](spec-format.md): the spec format applies to
artifacts that ship on `main` and need machine-readable metadata; the
plan format applies to discussion-thread comments whose machine-read
fields (id, status, related issue) are already carried by the GitHub
issue itself.

## Header conventions

The first line of every plan comment SHALL be a level-2 heading
matching exactly one of the patterns below.

| Comment kind | Header | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Initial plan | `## PLAN — issue #<N> (spec <NNNN>)` | R1 |
| Revision | `## PLAN v<N+1> — issue #<N> (spec <NNNN>) — revision after <trigger>` | R9 |
| Review (pass 1) | `## PLAN review — issue #<N>` (or `## PLAN review of v1 — issue #<N>`) followed by `### Verdict: APPROVE` or `### Verdict: REQUEST CHANGES` on the next non-empty line | R6 |
| Review (pass M ≥ 2) | `## PLAN review of v<M> — issue #<N>` followed by `### Verdict: APPROVE` or `### Verdict: REQUEST CHANGES` on the next non-empty line | R6 |

`<N>` is the logbook issue number, `<NNNN>` the zero-padded spec id,
`<M>` the plan revision ordinal being judged (`v1`, `v2`, etc.),
and `<trigger>` is a short noun phrase describing why the revision
exists (`DEV finding`, `user request`, `REQUEST CHANGES review`,
etc.). `## PLAN review — issue #<N>` is accepted as a backward-compatible
alias for `## PLAN review of v1 — issue #<N>`.

## Mandatory body sections

An initial or revised plan comment SHALL contain the level-3 headings
below that are mandatory at its complexity tier (see *Tier-conditioned
mandatory set*), in this order, with their text matching verbatim
(case-sensitive, no trailing punctuation). A future plan linter will
rely on header presence and ordering to validate conformance.

**1. `### Approach`** — one paragraph, plain prose. Captures the
semantics of the plan — *what stance the implementation takes* — in a
single breath. No file-by-file enumeration here; that belongs in
`### Steps`.

**2. `### Steps`** — ordered list. Each step SHALL name the concrete
file path(s) it touches and a one-line description of the edit. A step
MAY carry the `[P]` marker as its first token (after the list number)
to indicate the step CAN run in parallel with the preceding step;
absence of `[P]` means strictly sequential (R4).

```markdown
1. Edit `path/to/a.md` — add the X section after Y.
2. [P] Edit `path/to/b.md` — refresh the Z table.
3. Run `scripts/build-components.sh` and stage the regenerated outputs.
```

**3. `### Blast radius`** — bullet list. Each bullet names one of: an
affected code path, a downstream ticket, a build output, a version-bump
trigger (per *AGENTS.md → Version Bump Convention*), or a CLI-matrix
trigger surface (per *AGENTS.md → CLI Matrix Maintenance*). When a
category is genuinely empty for the ticket, state so explicitly
(`Build outputs: none.`) rather than omitting the bullet — silence
reads as oversight.

**4. `### Alternatives considered and rejected`** — at least one
alternative, each followed by a one-line rationale. The purpose is to
surface the design space the author traversed; a plan with zero
rejected alternatives is rarely a plan that explored options.

**5. `### Rollback strategy`** — one paragraph. Names the concrete
revert path (commit revert, configuration rollback, data migration
reversal, etc.) and any coordination required with downstream tickets
or deployed components.

## Tier-conditioned mandatory set

The complexity tier declared in the ticket's spec frontmatter (per
[ADR-0010](adr/0010-spec-plan-review-lifecycle.md) → *Complexity tiers
and team sizing*) determines which of the five sections above are
mandatory:

- At every tier — `trivial`, `small`, `standard`, and `large` —
  `### Approach` and `### Steps` are mandatory for a structured plan
  comment; the sole exception is the `trivial`-tier one-line plan
  confirmation admitted by spec 0138 R2 and by
  [ADR-0010](adr/0010-spec-plan-review-lifecycle.md) → *Stage
  definitions and transition rules* rule 3, which is a sufficient PLAN
  artifact without either section. That confirmation still carries the
  *Initial plan* header `## PLAN — issue #<N> (spec <NNNN>)` from
  *Header conventions* above, so it stays discoverable under the
  header patterns this document's preamble names and satisfies
  `specs/0004-plan-format-and-review.md` R1; it is exempt from the
  level-3 section set alone.
- At `trivial` and `small` tiers, `### Blast radius`,
  `### Alternatives considered and rejected`, and `### Rollback
  strategy` MAY be omitted; when present, they SHALL keep the format
  defined above.
- At `standard` and `large` tiers, all five sections remain mandatory
  (R1 of spec 0138).

These clauses bound the plan's size and the loop's length; they remove no item from the reviewer's checklist at any tier.

## Optional sections

**`### Risks`** — discrete risks with a one-line mitigation or
acceptance note each. When present, the section SHALL appear **after**
`### Rollback strategy` (R3). Plans that surface non-trivial
uncertainty SHOULD include it; plans whose blast radius is fully
bounded MAY omit it.

**`### Finding traceability`** (or `### Revision rationale & traceability`) —
a Markdown table mapping every reviewer-minted ID (`v<N>-F<M>`) raised across
prior review passes to its resolution or rationale in the revised plan comment.
Mandatory when revising a plan in response to a `REQUEST CHANGES` verdict.
The table SHALL carry the schema:

```markdown
| Plan Ver | Finding ID | Resolution / Rationale | Step |
|---|---|---|---|
| v1 | v1-F1 | Added preconditions step | Step 1 |
| v1 | v1-F2 | Clarified scope boundary | Step 3 |
```

The row count of addressed reviewer-minted IDs SHALL equal the total number
of findings raised across prior review passes (per `docs/plan-review-protocol.md`
→ *Countable invariant*).

## Finding tag schema

Every plan-review finding SHALL carry a reviewer-minted identifier in its header
(`v<N>-F<M>`) and exactly one `class:` field whose value is one of `tech`, `arch`,
or `spec` (R7). The class drives the loop target of the retroactive review loop;
the routing matrix is defined once, in [`docs/retroactive-loop.md`](retroactive-loop.md)
→ *Routing matrix* (restated in condensed form in
[ADR-0010](adr/0010-spec-plan-review-lifecycle.md) → *Routing matrix*),
and SHALL NOT be duplicated here.

A reviewer comment that lists multiple findings SHALL tag each
finding individually:

```markdown
**Finding 1 (v1-F1)**

class: tech
<one-paragraph description and remediation pointer>

**Finding 2 (v1-F2)**

class: arch
<one-paragraph description and remediation pointer>
```

Findings without a `class:` tag are malformed and SHALL be returned
to the reviewer for retagging before the routing engine consumes
them.

## Append-only revisions

Once a plan comment is validated (by the reviewer in autonomous
modes or by the user in `FULL` / `INTERMEDIATE` mode), it SHALL NOT
be edited or deleted (R9). Subsequent revisions are posted as **new
comments** with the revision header above, citing the trigger.
Silent edits of a validated plan break the audit trail the
retroactive review loop relies on and are prohibited.

## Worked example

The first live use of the PLAN stage was the validated plan for
issue #170 (the spec-PR workflow ticket), authored by the
`architect` role in `INTERMEDIATE` mode and validated by the user
before the implementation branch was cut. It is the canonical
worked example this document points to (R10):

- <https://github.com/crewrig/crewrig/issues/170#issuecomment-4588163138>

Readers should treat the comment's structure — five mandatory
sections, file-path-anchored steps, an explicit deferral
recommendation, zero `[P]` markers because the steps were
genuinely sequential — as the lived demonstration of the schema
above.
