# ADR 0016 — Shared MemPalace MCP HTTP server

<!-- crewrig-doc: section=architecture-adr nav_order=160 published=true title="ADR 0016 — Shared MemPalace MCP HTTP server" -->

**Status:** Accepted — 2026-08-08 (issue #728; owner-validated 2026-08-08 after
two rounds of review annotations)

## Framing

- **Goal.** Let every concurrent CLI session write to shared memory. Today the
  first session to mutate takes the palace writer lease and holds it until its
  process dies; every sibling session is refused for the rest of its life.
- **Constraints.** Multi-CLI parity (`AGENTS.md` → *Multi-CLI parity*); the
  corruption guarantee ADR-0006 established must not regress; the spec-0108
  runtime version guard must keep a place to stand; **transcript persistence
  must not regress** — spec 0110 made it survive a held lock and that outcome is
  a floor, not a bargaining chip; no MemPalace source modification.
- **Non-goals.** Partitioning the palace by sphere (orthogonal — see *Open
  questions*); changing the `-32001` semantics upstream; reworking the
  ChromaDB tier, which ADR-0006 already settled. **Deciding** the transcript
  hook's write path is explicitly deferred to a derived spec: this ADR scopes
  the question and states the constraints it must satisfy, but the answer
  depends on a latency measurement and on an upstream policy that is still
  moving.

## Context

### The observed failure

Three concurrent Claude Code sessions, 2026-08-08. Every mutating MemPalace
call from two of them returned MCP error `-32001` — *"Peer MCP writer active;
this server is read-only for mutating tools"*. The Session-End protocol
(`artifacts/core/rules/60-tools.md` → *Memory Activation Protocol*) mandates a
handoff-drawer update and a diary entry; neither could land.

The holder was identified directly:

```text
lsof ~/.mempalace/locks/mine_palace_e29dc40b24dad462.lock
Python  4837  hoanicross  6u  REG  ...
```

The lock filename is keyed by `sha256(realpath(palace_path))[:16]`; recomputing
it from `~/.mempalace/palace` produced the same key. The holder was **the most
recently started session** — twenty minutes old, blocking two sessions that had
been running for eight and ten hours. The lease goes to whoever mutates first,
not to whoever arrived first.

### The mechanism

`mempalace/mcp_server.py` → `_acquire_mcp_writer_lock()`:

- The lease **is** `mine_palace_lock(palace_path)` — an `fcntl.flock`, one per
  palace.
- It is acquired **lazily**, on the first mutating tool call, not at startup.
- It is released **only at process exit** (`atexit`). Idleness releases nothing.
- There is no backend conditional: the same lease is taken whether the ChromaDB
  client is `PersistentClient` or `HttpClient`.

It covers fourteen tools spanning two different stores — drawer writes that go
through the ChromaDB daemon, and `kg_*` writes that go straight to
`~/.mempalace/knowledge_graph.sqlite3`, a file outside the daemon's `--path`.

### The palace has three families of writers

The MCP servers are the loudest contender for the lease, but not the only one.
A decision about "who writes to the palace" that counts only MCP is incomplete:

1. **MCP servers** — one per CLI session. The subject of this ADR.
2. **The transcript hook** — `hooks/mempalace-transcript.sh`, fired on every
   session lifecycle event on all four CLIs. It writes **outside MCP**, from a
   short-lived subprocess, using the MemPalace Python library directly.
3. **The CLI and maintenance paths** — `mine`, `sync`, repair, and the harness
   curator's bundled batch reader.

Family 2 already collides with the lease, and spec 0110 already resolved that
collision — by the same reasoning this ADR generalises.

### Spec 0110 is the precedent, one path wide

`specs/0110-transcript-hook-lock-bypass.md` (status `implemented`, issue #713,
PR #715) states the problem in its Intent: a peer holding the lock is *"the
ordinary condition as soon as more than one agent or background task runs
against the same palace, and today the condition under which every transcript is
silently lost."*

Its remedy is a **lock relief**, and its guard rails are the interesting part:

- R2 — the relief takes effect **only after** the hook has established that the
  remote memory service is reachable. The ordering is normative: a write whose
  remote routing is not established keeps the lock's protection.
- R6 — the relief is confined to the hook's own interpreter. It rebinds an
  in-memory symbol (`mine_palace_lock` → a recording stand-in); it never
  releases or removes a lock another process holds.
- R3/R4 — if the relief is not actually in force on the path the entry takes,
  the hook declines to write and reports a dedicated exit status
  (`5 LOCK_BYPASS_INEFFECTIVE`), distinguishable from every other failure.

The principle spec 0110 established is precisely this ADR's: **once the store
sits behind a single reachable service, a per-process local lock is no longer
what protects it.** Spec 0110 applied that to one write path, defensively and
under proof of reachability. This ADR applies it to the topology, so the
condition becomes structurally true rather than locally worked around.

That framing also corrects a claim this ADR must not overstate: collapsing the
MCP tier does **not**, on its own, make the palace single-writer. The transcript
hook keeps writing directly. See *Consequences* and *Open questions*.

### Two tiers of sharing; only one was addressed

```text
Tier 2 — MCP      : N CLI sessions        → N stdio MemPalace processes   ← contention
Tier 1 — ChromaDB : N MemPalace processes → 1 `chroma run` daemon         ← ADR-0006
```

ADR-0006 applied the correct pattern — collapse N owners onto one daemon — one
tier too low. The naming compounds it: the "http" in
`scripts/lib/mempalace-http-wrapper.py` denotes the **ChromaDB client**, not the
MCP transport.

ADR-0006 is working, and measurably so — which is why this PR also promotes it
from `Proposed` to `Accepted`, evidence included, rather than leaving this
decision to rest on an unrecorded one. Palace `.drift-*` directories, which
record the corruption class it targeted:

| Period | Drift events |
|---|---|
| May 2026 | 2 |
| June 2026 | 133 |
| July 2026 | 130 |
| Since 2026-07-21 | **0** |

The last drift predates the current daemon's start. Eighteen days clean against
roughly 130 per month before. This ADR extends that result upward; it does not
revisit it.

### The upstream remedy already exists

`mempalace serve` (`cli.py` → `cmd_serve`) is described in its own docstring as
*"a turnkey wrapper over `mempalace-mcp --transport http`"*. It is not a
prototype:

- `ThreadingHTTPServer` with `daemon_threads = True` — **one process, N
  concurrent clients**.
- Per-palace bearer token, auto-generated and stored `0600` at
  `~/.mempalace/server/<sha256(palace)[:24]>/token`, stable across restarts. The
  token is passed to the child through the environment, never through `argv`.
- Optional TLS (`--tls-cert` / `--tls-key`), a `--read-only` mode, and an
  unauthenticated `/healthz` liveness endpoint.
- A token is *mandatory* on a non-loopback bind, matching `cmd_serve`'s own
  token-resolution guard. **Correction (spec 0136, #751):** the loopback half
  of this sentence was wrong as first written. On a loopback bind,
  `cmd_serve` does **not** mint a token automatically — its auto-generate
  branch fires only when the bind is non-loopback
  (`if not token and not loopback and not args.allow_insecure`,
  `mempalace/cli.py:1450`, verified at the pinned 3.6.0; the docstring at
  `mempalace/cli.py:1421` confirms it, describing the wrapper as
  "auto-generating a strong one for non-loopback binds"). A loopback server
  given no explicit `--token` or `MEMPALACE_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` serves
  unauthenticated. The decision this ADR records is unchanged by this
  correction — see *Daemon lifecycle* and the derived-spec launcher, which
  provisions and enforces a token itself rather than relying on upstream to
  mint one on loopback.

The lease is designed for exactly this topology. From `mine_palace_lock`'s
docstring:

> Re-entrant … lets the threaded MCP HTTP transport write from a worker thread
> while the long-lived writer-lease is held on another thread of the same
> process.

One process holds the lease; every client writes through it. The contention
disappears by construction. **This is not an upstream defect to report** — it is
a supported topology the framework has not adopted. It ships in the version the
framework already pins (`>=3.6.0,<3.7`).

### The framework already proved the client half

Spec 0091 established that all four CLIs consume an HTTP-transport MCP server,
with the translation to each native shape grounded empirically —
`docs/cli-matrix.md` row 7h: *"stdio and http/sse reach all four CLIs
(grounded)"*, mapping the neutral `url` to Claude's `--transport http`,
Gemini's and Copilot's `{type,url,headers}`, and Antigravity's
`{serverUrl,headers}`.

Every piece exists. None has been pointed at MemPalace itself, which remains
registered over stdio in all four surfaces.

## Decision

Adopt a **single supervised MemPalace MCP HTTP daemon** owning the palace writer
lease, and register MemPalace over `--transport http` in all four CLI surfaces.

### Topology

```text
`chroma run` ──────────────── sole PersistentClient + sole HNSW compactor  (ADR-0006)
        ↑ 127.0.0.1:8001
mempalace MCP HTTP daemon ── sole writer-lease holder                      (this ADR)
        ↑ 127.0.0.1:<port>, bearer token
Claude Code ×N ─┐
Gemini CLI      ├─→ all clients, all sessions, concurrent
Copilot CLI     │
Antigravity CLI ┘
```

### The two tiers must compose

The daemon **must be launched through `scripts/lib/mempalace-http-wrapper.py`**,
not through a bare `mempalace serve`. The wrapper monkey-patches
`chromadb.PersistentClient` before `mempalace` is imported and then calls
`mempalace.mcp_server.main()`; a bare `mempalace serve` `execve`s the module
directly and would resolve `PersistentClient` unpatched — re-introducing the
second `PersistentClient` that ADR-0006 exists to prevent, and bypassing the
spec-0108 launch-time version guard that lives in the same wrapper.

This is the central implementation constraint of this ADR: **collapsing tier 2
must not un-collapse tier 1.**

### Fail loud, never silent

ADR-0006's contract is carried over verbatim to the new tier. If the MCP daemon
is unreachable, the CLI's MCP registration must fail visibly — never fall back
to spawning a stdio MemPalace process, which would silently restore the
contention this ADR removes and mask the outage.

### Daemon lifecycle

Supervised per OS, mirroring the ChromaDB daemon: a launchd user agent on macOS
with `KeepAlive=true`, a systemd user unit on Linux with `Restart=always`.

`MEMPALACE_MCP_IDLE_HOURS` (default 8 h) terminates the server after an idle
period — a guard designed for per-session stdio servers, where stale processes
accumulate. On a supervised shared daemon it is either counter-productive
(a restart cycles the lease for no reason) or harmless (the supervisor restarts
it immediately). The derived spec sets it deliberately rather than inheriting
the default.

### Prefer upstream write routing over a framework-side switch

Where a write path must be steered — the transcript hook being the open case —
the framework SHALL use MemPalace's own routing policy rather than invent a
crewrig-side equivalent. `config.py` (`resolve_write_routing`) already exposes
per-caller policies (`MEMPALACE_HOOK_WRITE_ROUTING`,
`MEMPALACE_CLI_WRITE_ROUTING`, plus a global `MEMPALACE_WRITE_ROUTING`) with a
documented precedence chain and `direct` as the default. Two sibling mechanisms
steering the same writes would eventually disagree, and the framework's would
lose.

Feasibility caveat, stated rather than hidden: the upstream docstring says the
foundation *"does not change current hook or CLI behavior"* and that
*"policy-aware consumers are introduced by follow-up PRs"*. The mechanism exists;
its consumers do not yet. The derived specs re-check its state at implementation
time and fall back to a framework-side steer **only** if upstream still cannot
carry the case — recording that as an explicit, time-stamped deviation, not as a
default.

## Alternatives considered

### A. Status quo — retry once, then fall back (spec 0103)

- **Pro:** already specified and implemented; zero new moving parts.
- **Con:** it is a *loss-mitigation* protocol, not a fix. Its fallback is
  "file the friction as an issue" — which covers friction tagging only, and has
  no counterpart for the Session-End memory flush that this ADR's motivating
  incident actually lost.
- **Verdict:** retained as the degraded-path safety net, not as the answer.

### B. `MEMPALACE_MCP_ALLOW_PEER_WRITER=1`

- **Pro:** one environment variable; instant.
- **Con:** disables the guard for *all* fourteen mutating tools, including the
  `kg_*` writes to `knowledge_graph.sqlite3`, which sit outside the ChromaDB
  daemon's protection. It removes the symptom and the diagnostic at once: the
  day the lease matters, nothing reports it.
- **Verdict:** rejected as a durable setting; acceptable only as a one-off
  operator escape hatch.

### C. Ask upstream to make the lease backend-conditional

- **Pro:** would shrink the lease to the stores that still need it.
- **Con:** the shared HTTP server already solves the problem completely, in the
  pinned version. Asking upstream to change a mechanism whose supported
  alternative we have not adopted is asking them to work around our
  configuration.
- **Verdict:** rejected. Should the derived specs uncover a real gap in the
  HTTP topology, this reopens on evidence.

### D. One palace per sphere

- **Pro:** the lease is keyed per palace, so sessions on different projects
  would stop contending. It would also serve the sphere-tightness rule in the
  operator's own organization rules, which a single palace mixing client,
  employer, and personal wings does not.
- **Con:** does not help two sessions on the *same* project — the exact case
  observed. It is a data-partitioning decision with migration consequences,
  independent of transport.
- **Verdict:** orthogonal and worth its own ADR; not a substitute for this one.

### E. Bare `mempalace serve`, no wrapper

- **Pro:** the shortest path — one supervised command.
- **Con:** breaks ADR-0006 and the spec-0108 guard, as set out in *The two tiers
  must compose*.
- **Verdict:** rejected.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Writer contention **between CLI sessions** is eliminated by construction: one
  lease, one holder, every session writing through it. `-32001` between sibling
  sessions becomes unreachable in the nominal path. Scope stated precisely: this
  is the MCP family (writer family 1). The transcript hook still writes directly
  under its spec-0110 relief, so "one writer for the whole palace" is **not** a
  claim this ADR makes — see *Open questions*.
- N MemPalace processes collapse to one — less resident memory, fewer ChromaDB
  connection pools, one log instead of N interleaved.
- The spec-0108 version guard gets a single, authoritative enforcement point
  instead of one per session.
- Symmetric across all four CLIs by construction: the registration is a client
  concern, and spec 0091 already ships the per-CLI translation.
- Consistent with ADR-0006 — the same pattern, the same fail-loud contract, one
  tier up.

### Negative / trade-offs

- **A second SPOF.** Memory dies for every session at once instead of for one.
  Mitigated by the supervisor and by fail-loud detection, exactly as ADR-0006
  mitigated the first.
- **A second loopback port**, plus a bearer token to provision and to keep out
  of `argv` and out of committed config.
- **Version-guard semantics shift.** Today each session serves the MemPalace
  version its own interpreter resolves; afterwards every session is served by
  the daemon's version. A session started after an upgrade keeps talking to the
  pre-upgrade daemon until it is restarted. The derived spec must state how the
  daemon is cycled on upgrade, and `scripts/doctor-mempalace.sh` must report the
  daemon's served version rather than four per-CLI registrations.
- **Startup ordering grows a step:** ChromaDB daemon → MCP daemon → CLI session.

### Blast radius

In scope for the derived specs:

- Supervisor units for the MCP daemon under `config/`, alongside the ChromaDB
  units.
- The four `setup-*-interactive.sh`, switching the `mempalace` registration from
  stdio to `--transport http` with its token, using the spec-0091 translation.
- `scripts/doctor-mempalace.sh` — report the daemon rather than per-session
  registrations.
- `docs/cli-matrix.md` rows 7c and 7d, and the MemPalace entries they describe.
- Taskfile entries for daemon lifecycle, mirroring the ChromaDB ones.
- Conditionally, and only if the first open question resolves that way:
  `hooks/mempalace-transcript.sh` and the four `hooks/*-transcript-hooks.json`
  manifests — plus a revisit of spec 0110, whose relief would become dead code.

Out of scope: the palace-partitioning question (D), the ChromaDB tier, and any
MemPalace source change.

## Derived spec plan

1. **Daemon and supervisor** — launch through the wrapper, supervisor units for
   both OSes, health check, deliberate `MEMPALACE_MCP_IDLE_HOURS`, fail-loud
   probe. Must land first; everything else depends on it.
2. **Four-CLI registration** — stdio → HTTP in every setup script, token
   provisioning, no committed secret. Symmetric by the parity rule.
3. **Migration and diagnostics** — detect and replace a pre-existing stdio
   registration, cycle the daemon on MemPalace upgrade, extend
   `doctor-mempalace.sh`.
4. **Transcript-hook write path** — resolve the first open question below: keep
   the spec-0110 direct write with its relief, or route the hook through the
   daemon. Steered through upstream write routing per *Prefer upstream write
   routing*; must preserve spec 0110's guard rails either way. Deliberately
   late: it is the only step that can regress a path which currently works.

   **Latency measurement — mandatory, blocking.** This spec SHALL NOT choose a
   shape on judgement. It SHALL measure, against the real palace with the daemon
   from step 1 running, the wall-clock cost of one hook-equivalent write through
   the MCP daemon versus the current direct path, at each of the four lifecycle
   events, on a palace of production size — the authoring palace held 24 481
   drawers when this ADR was written, and a measurement on an empty palace
   proves nothing. The comparison SHALL be reported in the spec, not merely
   asserted, and SHALL state the p95 rather than a single sample.

   The pass criterion is the hook's own five-second self-cap: a routed write
   whose p95 does not fit **well** inside that budget — leaving room for a
   loaded machine, not just an idle one — disqualifies shape (b), and the ADR's
   open question resolves to (a) on evidence rather than on preference.

   This measurement cannot be taken today: the daemon does not exist yet, and
   measuring against a scratch palace would answer a different question. That is
   why it is a requirement on this step rather than a figure in this ADR.
5. **Documentation** — `docs/cli-matrix.md`, the ADR-0006 cross-reference, and
   the runbook.

## Open questions

- **Where do the transcript hook's writes go once the daemon exists?** Two
  shapes. This ADR does not pick one, and states the criterion that decides it:
  **which topology is correct**, not which is cheaper to build. Implementation
  cost is not a discriminant here — a one-off cost cannot outweigh a permanent
  structural property.
  - **(a) Unchanged** — the hook keeps writing directly under its spec-0110
    relief. The palace stays multi-writer, and a bypass stays alive whose
    precondition (a reachable remote service) the new topology makes permanently
    true. A bypass whose guard can no longer fail is either redundant or
    load-bearing in a way nobody has stated; both readings deserve an answer
    before it is kept.
  - **(b) Routed through the MCP daemon** — the hook stops writing directly, the
    relief becomes dead code, and the palace becomes genuinely single-writer:
    one lease, one holder, no exceptions to reason about. It costs the hook an
    HTTP round trip per lifecycle event on a path deliberately built to be
    non-blocking — spec 0073 R3/R4 soft-skip on an unreachable daemon, and the
    hook caps itself at five seconds so a lock cannot stall the calling CLI.
  The deciding input is therefore a **measurement, not a preference** — see the
  latency requirement in *Derived spec plan* step 4. Whichever shape wins, spec
  0110's guard rails are the floor: a write must not proceed on an unproven
  path, and an ineffective relief must stay distinguishable in the exit status.
- **Does the wrapper forward `argv` to `mcp_server.main()`?** The handoff calls
  `main()` with no explicit arguments, so it reads `sys.argv`. Passing
  `--transport http --host … --port …` through the wrapper is expected to work
  but must be verified in DEV before spec 1 commits to the launch line.
- **Token on a loopback bind** — mint one anyway (defence in depth), or rely
  on the loopback boundary instead? **Correction (spec 0136, #751):** this
  question's premise was wrong as first written — minting one anyway would
  *diverge* from `cmd_serve`'s own default on loopback, not match it; see
  the correction under *The upstream remedy already exists* above. The
  question itself is unaffected by the correction and stays open.
- **What becomes of spec 0103?** Its `-32001` fallback stops describing the
  expected case. Keep it as the degraded-path net, or restate its trigger?
- **Is a per-session read-only client worth it?** `MEMPALACE_MCP_READ_ONLY`
  would let a session declare itself a reader; probably unnecessary once one
  writer serves everyone, but it is the natural place to ask.

### Addendum: Resolution of Derived Spec 4 (spec 0164, issue #753)

The transcript hook write path open question was resolved in favor of shape (b) — routing through the MCP daemon via `curl`. The direct Python invocation and its associated lock bypass (spec 0110) were retired in favor of an HTTP JSON-RPC `tools/call`. The latency measurement on a production-sized palace demonstrated that the `curl` call fit well within the 5.0-second execution budget.
