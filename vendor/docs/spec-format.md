# Specification format

<!-- crewrig-doc: section=reference nav_order=20 published=true title="Specification format" -->

This document defines the normative file format for the SPECS stage of
the lifecycle introduced in
[ADR-0010](adr/0010-spec-plan-review-lifecycle.md). It is the contract
that every spec under `/specs/` SHALL satisfy and that downstream
tooling (the `spec-author` skill in issue #168, the routing engine in
issue #172, the future spec linter) will rely on.

The format is intentionally minimal: YAML frontmatter for machine-read
fields, Markdown body for human-read content, a fixed set of mandatory
sections so a reviewer always knows where to look.

## Frontmatter schema

Every spec file SHALL open with a YAML frontmatter block delimited by
`---` lines. Fields are listed below with their type, cardinality, and
constraints. Unknown fields are tolerated by the format but SHOULD NOT
be introduced without first amending this document.

| Field | Type | Required | Constraint |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | yes | `<NNNN>` zero-padded to four digits, monotonic, allocated by the ticket creator. Must match the filename prefix. |
| `slug` | string | yes | kebab-case, ASCII, no leading/trailing hyphen. Must match the filename slug. |
| `status` | enum | yes | One of `draft`, `approved`, `implemented`, `archived`, `superseded`. |
| `complexity` | enum | yes | One of `trivial`, `small`, `standard`, `large`. Must match an ADR-0010 complexity tier. |
| `interaction-mode` | enum | from `approved` onward | One of `FULL`, `INTERMEDIATE`, `MINIMAL`, `AUTO`. Must match an ADR-0010 interaction mode. MAY be omitted in `draft`, in which case the value defaults to `INTERMEDIATE`; SHALL be present explicitly once the spec reaches `approved`. |
| `related-issue` | integer | yes | The GitHub issue number this spec qualifies (the logbook anchor, per `AGENTS.md` → *Logbook Issues → Rule A*). |
| `version` | semver | yes | Starts at `1.0.0` on the initial spec. Bumps follow the delta-spec convention below. |
| `max-iterations` | integer | no | Overrides the ADR-0010 default of 5. Bounded `[1, 20]` inclusive. Omit to inherit the default. |
| `superseded-by` | string | conditional | Required when `status: superseded`, prohibited otherwise. Value is the `id` of the spec that supersedes this one. |
| `unsecured-id` | boolean | no | **Absent by default, and carries meaning only when present and `true`.** Marks a spec whose `id` was allocated locally but never secured on the reference repository — the fallback of `specs/0112-spec-id-reservation.md` requirement 9, reached when the author is offline or contributing from a fork. `scripts/reserve-spec-id.sh` emits this exact line on stdout on its exit-3 path, so the author pastes rather than composes it. `scripts/check-spec-id-reserved.sh` reports the condition at pull-request time: blocking for a pull request from the reference repository, non-blocking for one from a fork. The mark SHALL be removed in the same act that secures the id (requirement 10) — a merged spec never carries it. Never back-filled onto an existing spec. |

### Worked frontmatter

```yaml
---
id: "0042"
slug: build-dryrun-flag
status: approved
complexity: standard
interaction-mode: INTERMEDIATE
related-issue: 421
version: 1.0.0
---
```

## Mandatory body sections

A spec body SHALL contain the following five sections, in this order,
each introduced by a level-2 heading. Sections MAY be empty in a draft
but MUST be present (a future linter relies on header presence to
validate format conformance).

### 1. `## Intent`

One paragraph, plain prose, that captures the user-facing WHAT in a
single breath. The intent answers "what would a user notice if this
spec were realized?". HOW words (`by`, `via`, `using`, technology
names, library choices) are forbidden here; they belong in the plan
artifact defined in issue #169.

### 2. `## Requirements`

Numbered list. Each line is a normative statement using either `SHALL`
or `MUST`. Imperatives without a modal verb are forbidden ("the system
sends a notification" is not a requirement; "the system SHALL send a
notification" is). HOW words are forbidden inside a requirement line
for the same reason as in `## Intent`.

Each requirement SHOULD be independently testable. A requirement that
cannot be reduced to a scenario in `## Scenarios` is a smell — either
split it, or move the untestable part to `## Out of scope`.

### 3. `## Scenarios`

Each scenario uses the Given / When / Then form:

```text
**Scenario:** <short title>

Given <pre-condition>
When  <triggering action>
Then  <observable outcome>
```

A spec SHALL include at least one happy-path scenario and at least one
failure-path scenario. Scenarios are the bridge between the spec and
the regression tests that the `tester` agent will produce in DEV; if a
scenario cannot be turned into an automated check, escalate to the
plan stage for a manual-verification clause.

### 4. `## Out of scope`

Bullet list. Each bullet names a behavior, an integration, or a
boundary that this spec deliberately excludes. The spec reviewer
rejects implicit scope; if a behavior is not explicitly in
`## Requirements` and not explicitly excluded here, the spec is
under-specified and SHALL be sent back to the author.

This section MAY be empty only for a `trivial`-tier spec.

### 5. `## Open questions`

Bullet list. Captures unresolved questions at authoring time. The
section MAY be empty. If non-empty in a `status: approved` spec, the
reviewer SHALL require written closure on the logbook issue (per
`AGENTS.md` → *Logbook Issues*) before approval — questions left open
in an approved spec are pre-baked `spec`-class findings in the REVIEW
loop and waste a downstream iteration.

## Delta-spec convention

`spec`-class findings produced by the REVIEW loop (per ADR-0010 →
*Finding classification taxonomy*) do not edit the original spec on
`main`. The original's **normative content** is immutable once merged;
corrections chain via delta-spec files. (Lifecycle *metadata* — `status`,
`superseded-by` — and meaning-preserving editorial edits are exempt from this
freeze; see *Lifecycle states → Recording a status transition* and *Editorial
edits*.)

### File layout

```text
/specs/<NNNN>-<slug>.md                # original (immutable on main)
/specs/<NNNN>-<slug>.delta-01.md       # first delta
/specs/<NNNN>-<slug>.delta-02.md       # second delta, builds on delta-01
```

Delta numbers are zero-padded to two digits and allocated monotonically
per parent spec.

### Delta-spec frontmatter

A delta-spec carries the same frontmatter schema as the original, with
two additional constraints:

- `id` SHALL be the parent's id (the file is identified by its
  filename suffix, not by a new id).
- `version` SHALL bump the parent's version per the rules below.
- The delta-spec body replaces the mandatory body sections with the
  three delta sections defined next.

### Delta-spec body sections

```markdown
## ADDED

<requirements, scenarios, or out-of-scope items that the delta introduces>

## MODIFIED

<requirements, scenarios, or out-of-scope items the delta changes; quote the
original line, then show the replacement>

## REMOVED

<items the delta deletes; quote the original line>
```

The three delta sections SHALL be authored at H2 level. The H1 of a
delta-spec file remains the spec's title; no intermediate H2 wrapper
(`## Body`, `## Delta sections`, or any other) SHALL be introduced.

All three sections MUST be present (empty is allowed); the linter will
check for presence, not content. This mirrors the OpenSpec delta
convention so external readers familiar with that vocabulary recognize
the structure.

### Versioning

The `version` field on a delta-spec records the cumulative state of
the parent after the delta lands. Bump per semver intent:

- `PATCH` — clarification, wording fix, scenario added without
  changing any existing requirement.
- `MINOR` — additive normative change (new requirement, new scenario
  that constrains a previously unspecified case).
- `MAJOR` — breaking normative change (requirement modified or
  removed in a way that invalidates an in-flight implementation).

The cumulative version is read from the highest-numbered delta-spec;
the original file's `version` is never edited after merge.

## Lifecycle states

The `status` field tracks where the spec sits in its own life. Each
transition has a single authority and an accompanying artifact; the
table below is the contract.

| `status` | Trigger | Authority | Accompanying artifact |
|---|---|---|---|
| `draft` | Spec file opened in the working branch | Spec author (human or `spec-author` skill) | Spec file in the worktree, no PR yet |
| `approved` | Spec PR merged on `main` | Spec reviewer (per the interaction mode declared in frontmatter) | Merged spec PR — its own (squash) commit already carries `status: approved`, so no separate status-transition PR is opened — plus a logbook comment recording the approval |
| `implemented` | Implementation PR for `related-issue` merged on `main` | Implementation team's `pr-logbook` | Merged implementation PR — its own (squash) commit already carries `status: implemented`, so no separate status-transition PR is opened — plus a logbook closure comment |
| `archived` | Related issue closed without implementation (`won't fix`, duplicate, abandoned) | Ticket closer | Logbook comment explaining the archival |
| `superseded` | A newer spec replaces this one (often through a `spec`-class loop that grows beyond a delta) | Author of the superseding spec | `superseded-by` field set; superseding spec exists with its own id |

A `status` regression (e.g. `approved` → `draft`) is prohibited; if a
spec must be re-opened, supersede it instead.

### No spec on `main` is a draft

A spec file present on `main`, other than a delta-spec, SHALL NOT carry
`status: draft`. A spec reaches `main` only by its own merged spec-PR, which is
the trigger the table above assigns to `approved`; `draft` on `main` therefore
records a contradiction rather than a lagging value, and leaves a reader unable
to use `status` for the one question it exists to answer — "merged and in
force" or "proposed but never landed".

The rule is enforced mechanically rather than by recall. The spec linter
(`scripts/lib/spec-linter.js`, run as `task spec:lint` in CI) enforces status
invariants across all pull requests and on `main` (governed by
[`specs/0109-spec-status-invariant-on-main.md`](../specs/0109-spec-status-invariant-on-main.md)
and [`specs/0168-spec-status-transition-enforcement.md`](../specs/0168-spec-status-transition-enforcement.md)):

- **Spec PRs (`spec/<NNNN>-*` or introducing a new spec):** CI fails (`[FAIL]`)
  if an added or modified non-delta spec file carries `status: draft`. The spec
  must transition to `status: approved` (and declare `interaction-mode`) before
  merging to `main`.
- **Implementation PRs (`(feat|fix|refactor|perf|chore)/<NNNN>-*`):** CI fails
  (`[FAIL]`) if the corresponding specification file `specs/<NNNN>-*.md` does not
  carry `status: implemented`.
- **Base branch status check:** The linter names every non-delta spec already
  present on the change's base branch that carries `status: draft`. Delta-specs
  are exempt per Spec 0109.

**Which build the violation fails, and which it only warns.** Being named and
being failed are two different things, decided by two different questions. A
change that **modifies** a named spec is failed by it (`[FAIL]`), because it can
record the correct status in the same edit. A change that does not — a pull
request touching no spec at all, say — gets the same spec named as a
**non-blocking** warning (`[WARN]`) and passes: a check a change has no power to
satisfy must not block it. The build that does fail in that case is the base
branch's own, where `HEAD` is the base and there is therefore no change to
charge the violation to. So **a `[WARN]` met on a pull request is a statement
about `main`, not about that pull request**: it is cleared by correcting the
named spec's status on the base branch, and nothing in the change under test
will make it go away. When the linter cannot determine which files the change
modifies, it reports every named spec as blocking and says so — an
indeterminate answer never becomes an exemption.
[`specs/0109-spec-status-invariant-on-main.delta-02.md`](../specs/0109-spec-status-invariant-on-main.delta-02.md)
is the contract.

### Recording a status transition

The append-only rule (see *Delta-spec convention*) governs a spec's
**normative content** — the body sections (`## Intent`, `## Requirements`,
`## Scenarios`, `## Out of scope`, `## Open questions`) and the identifying
frontmatter fields (`id`, `slug`). It does **not** freeze the
lifecycle-tracking metadata: the `status` and `superseded-by` fields are
*expected* to change, since the table above defines transitions the spec
undergoes over its life.

Those transitions divide into three kinds, recorded differently. The first,
`draft` → `approved`, is recorded **inside the spec-PR's own commit**, so the
spec lands on `main` already carrying `status: approved`. The second,
`approved` → `implemented`, is recorded **inside the implementation PR's own
commit**, so the spec carries `status: implemented` the moment its
implementation lands on `main`. Every **later** transition — `→ superseded`,
`→ archived` — is recorded **after** the spec has merged, by a metadata-only
edit to the merged spec's frontmatter. The three cases are defined in turn
below.

**Recording the initial `draft` → `approved` transition (in the spec-PR).**
Every interaction mode has a real approval event whose grant the recorded
`status: approved` reflects, but **which** user gate constitutes that event
is mode-dependent. In `FULL`, `INTERMEDIATE`, and `MINIMAL` the approval
event is the **SPECS-stage content-approval gate**; because the approved
spec content becomes a one-file spec-PR that merges unchanged, that same
content-approval discharges the spec-PR's merge-authorization request, which
is therefore not fired a second time (see
[`interaction-modes.md`](interaction-modes.md) → *User-gate definition*). In
`AUTO`, where no SPECS-stage content-approval gate runs, the approval event
is the **merge-authorization request**, which still fires and remains the
sole approval event. The rule is thus mode-independent in effect — no mode
lacks a real approval decision to record — while the gate that constitutes
that decision differs by mode. The transition SHALL be recorded **only
after** that approval event has been secured; recording `status: approved`
ahead of it is a violation, because a recorded `approved` status must reflect
an approval decision that has actually been made, not one presumed before it.
The edit stays **metadata-only** in the sense the
next paragraph defines: it sets `status` to `approved` and, when
`interaction-mode` was omitted while the spec was `draft`, sets
`interaction-mode` to the mode the spec was qualified under (the frontmatter
schema requires it to be present once a spec is `approved`); it touches no
body line, no `id`, no `slug`, and no `version`. Recorded this way, the merged
spec-PR carries `status: approved` at the moment it lands on `main` — a merged
spec is never at once merged and still `draft` — and **no** separate,
post-merge, metadata-only pull request is required to record the approval.

*Merge mechanic.* Strictly **after** the approval event has been secured
and strictly **before** running `bash scripts/merge-spec-pr.sh`, on the spec-PR branch
(`spec/<NNNN>-<slug>`) edit the spec's frontmatter (`status: draft` →
`status: approved`, adding `interaction-mode` if it was omitted during
`draft`), create a **new commit** — not `git commit --amend` — then `git push`
and only then `bash scripts/merge-spec-pr.sh`. A new commit rather than an amend
because the spec-PR squash-merges, so both routes collapse to the same single
commit on `main` carrying `status: approved`; a new commit needs only a plain
`git push`, whereas an amend would force `git push --force-with-lease` and
risk clobbering a concurrent reviewer or CI push on the shared branch.

**Recording the `approved` → `implemented` transition (in the implementation
PR).** The `implemented` transition is triggered by the merge of the
implementation PR for the spec's `related-issue` — a genuinely later, separate
event that cannot be folded into the spec-PR that introduces the spec, but
**can** be folded into the implementation PR itself. On the implementation
feature branch, before the implementation PR merges, edit the spec's
frontmatter (`status: approved` → `status: implemented`), create a **new
commit** — not `git commit --amend` — then `git push`. The implementation PR
squash-merges, so the transition rides the implementation PR's own squash
commit and the spec lands on `main` already carrying `status: implemented` at
the moment its implementation lands. The authority named in the table above
(the implementation team's `pr-logbook`) performs the edit; it touches nothing
else — no body line, no `id`, no `slug`, no `version`. A diff that alters any
normative content under cover of the status bump is a violation. No separate,
post-merge, metadata-only pull request is required to record the transition.

**Recording a post-merge transition (every other transition).** Every
transition other than `draft` → `approved` and `approved` → `implemented` —
`→ superseded`, `→ archived` — is triggered by a genuinely later, separate
event (a superseding spec landing, a ticket closed without implementation)
that cannot be folded into the spec-PR that introduces the spec, and so is
recorded **after** merge by a **metadata-only edit** to the merged spec's
frontmatter. The authority named in the table above changes the `status` field
(and sets `superseded-by` when moving to `superseded`) and touches nothing
else — no body line, no `id`, no `slug`, no `version`. A diff that alters any
normative content under cover of a status bump is a violation. The `version`
field stays immutable on the original after merge; the cumulative version
lives on the highest-numbered delta (per *Versioning*).

This carve-out admits lifecycle metadata. A second, equally narrow carve-out
admits meaning-preserving editorial edits to body prose; it is defined next.

### Editorial edits

Alongside the lifecycle-metadata carve-out above, the append-only rule permits
**meaning-preserving editorial edits** — orthography and typo corrections — to
the body prose of a merged spec. An editorial edit may change the spelling or
surface form of a word but SHALL NOT alter meaning. Permitted: fixing a
misspelling, normalizing a British spelling to American, repairing a typo.

Forbidden, still: any change to the substance of a requirement, scenario,
intent, or out-of-scope item. Correcting the spelling of a word inside a
requirement is allowed; changing what that requirement obliges, permits, or
forbids is not. Substantive corrections chain via **delta-specs** (see
*Delta-spec convention*), never as in-place edits — exactly as before this
carve-out. A diff that alters normative meaning under cover of an editorial
fix is a violation, mirroring the same guard on the lifecycle-metadata
carve-out.

This carve-out is deliberately narrow in the same spirit as the
lifecycle-metadata one: it admits surface-form corrections only, leaving every
normative guarantee of the merged spec untouched.

## Naming convention

Spec files live under the top-level `/specs/` directory. The naming
pattern is fixed:

- Original: `/specs/<NNNN>-<kebab-slug>.md`
- Delta: `/specs/<NNNN>-<kebab-slug>.delta-<NN>.md`

`<NNNN>` is the spec id, zero-padded to four digits, allocated
monotonically across the whole repository (not per-year, not
per-component). The ticket creator picks the next free number by
inspecting the existing `/specs/` directory before opening the spec
file. Collisions are resolved by the second author bumping to the next
free number; spec ids are cheap and never reused.

`<kebab-slug>` mirrors the `slug` frontmatter field. The filename slug
and the frontmatter slug SHALL match exactly.

`<NN>` (delta suffix) is zero-padded to two digits and unique within
its parent.

## Spec linter

The format is machine-checked by the spec linter (`scripts/lib/spec-linter.js`,
invoked via `task spec:lint` and enforced in CI on every pull request via the
`lint-specs` job). The linter enforces the following invariants:

- The file SHALL pass `markdownlint-cli` with the project's
  `.markdownlintrc` configuration (CI invocation: `markdownlint
  "**/*.md" --ignore node_modules --ignore extension-skeleton --ignore
  communication`). In particular: no MD018 traps (do not let a wrapped
  line start with `#NNN` at column 1 — write `issue #NNN` or reflow
  the sentence).
- The five mandatory body section headings SHALL be present and SHALL
  appear in the order defined above. Heading text SHALL match
  verbatim (case-sensitive, no trailing punctuation).
- The frontmatter SHALL parse as YAML and SHALL contain every required
  field listed in the schema table.
- For a delta-spec, the three delta section headings (`## ADDED`,
  `## MODIFIED`, `## REMOVED`) SHALL be present in that order, at H2
  level. The H1 of a delta-spec file is the spec title; no
  intermediate H2 wrapper is allowed.
- Enum-valued fields SHALL contain a value from the listed set; any
  other value is a lint error.
- Status invariants are verified per the transition rules described above
  (governed by Spec 0109 and Spec 0168).
